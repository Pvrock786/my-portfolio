No matter\n          what stream, the participants collaborate all kinds of knowledge from various\n          elements of life to create something different, and sometimes ‘Jugad’ to\n          ‘Startups’.\n          With a new brio, techFEST’20 has pledged to be unparalleled and\n          unrivaled from its fellow versions. The Cosmic-Yantra is ready for an astonishing\n          exploration of the Cosmos and we are thrilled by the preparations conducted by\n          our students. This year, the multitude is going to witness intellections that are\n          going to be electrifying, hair-raising and mind-bending.\n          My all best wishes to my future India Technocrats for their effective\n          participation and performances in the National Level Event.\n        </p>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"faculty-message\">\n            <div className=\"name-2 name\"><h2>Vice Chairman's Message (techFEST’20)</h2></div>\n            <div className=\"message reverse\">\n              <div><img className=\"faculty-image\" src={teamphoto4} alt=\"img here\" />\n                <h4>Ms. Anshuka Bansal</h4>\n\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <p className=\"paragraph\">\n                  “Do not wait; the time will never be ‘just right.’\u001eStart where you stand, and work with\n          whatever tools you may have at your command, and better tools will be found as you\n          go along.” —George Herbert\n          When the techFEST started in the year 1999, there were many doubts and\n          apprehensions about it. But, the quote above guided our predecessors and still guides\n          us today to keep striving for the best and keep believing in the fact that no matter how\n          hard the goal is to achieve, the journey to it may be challenging but is always enjoyable.\n          The two-day annual festival is not just a competition but it is also an amalgamation of\n          fun and learning where spectacular ideas are displayed, and students learn and feel\n          inspired. I \u001frmly believe that techFEST’20 will be highly enjoyable and mesmerizing for\n          its participants and audience. In the end I would like to thank the organizing team and\n          invite all the inquisitive brains to come compete, achieve and most importantly enjoy\n          the technical \u001festa in march.\n        </p>\n              </div>\n\n            </div>\n\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n    )\n  }\n}"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
